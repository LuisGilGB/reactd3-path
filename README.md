# React Path

A Path component for React.

## Getting Started

These instructions will let you use the Path component in your application.

### Prerequisites

This component is created for React JS, so you need to use it in a React application to work.


### Installing

Install this component as a dependency from npm.

Then, in your application it should be enough to import the component as it is usually done in React:

```
